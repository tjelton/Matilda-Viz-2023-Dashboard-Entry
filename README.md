## Support Statment

**As part of the submission, we were asked to provide a statment about our dashboard. Here is my statment:**

My dashboard tells a story of the sad reality of suicide in the world and Australia. To build upon the data-story notion, I separated my dashboard into four chapters that each progressively explore suicide. The first chapter explores the lives lost from suicide globally, before chapters two and three focus specifically on suicide and mental health in Australia. We end with chapter four which focuses on a case study of the great work that Lifeline does in supporting Australians in crisis.

Data was sourced primarily from the World Health Organisation Mortality Database, as well as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. From there, data cleaning was conducted in R. This proved quite challenging as data from the mortality database had to be merged with other data sets. Additionally, the Australian data was not in a form suitable for plotting and analysis.

The dashboard was constructed using Shiny for R, and most of the plots leveraged the Plotly package to create interactive visualisations. Additionally, the leaflet package was utilised for creating a choropleth map. Multiple packages were utilised to bring the dashboard to life, and these are documented within the dashboard.
