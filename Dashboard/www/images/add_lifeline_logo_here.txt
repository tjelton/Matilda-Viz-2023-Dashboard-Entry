To recreate the dashboard as seen in the deployed version, please add a Lifeline logo png to this folder here.

The Lifeline logo was not added by me as this is the property of Lifeline, and I did not want to place it in a public repository.

The logo can be easily found on Google Images or the Lifeline website.

**The image must be named "lifeline-logo.png"!**
