                                           For example, in the \"Deaths From Suicide By Country\" plot, the United States of America had by far the highest number of lives

                                           is largely attributed to population size - the USA has roughly 13 times the number of people as Australia.<br><br>

                                           we see that Australia has one of the higher suicide rates in the world - only slightly lower than the USA.<br><br>

                                          illnesses such as cancer. However, our investigation is going to yield a disturbing truth - that suicide is one of the leading
